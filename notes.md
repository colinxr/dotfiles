i need to be able to run php pest tests from neovim.

i need to abe able to access .env files when finding files

the markdown writing experience is kind of lame in NEOVIM. the colours on
highlights and the autocomplete feature is kind of bogus

i would LOVE to be able to hide a pane in tmux rather than zoom into a specific
pane.

when I pull down changes in this repo, i'd like to run the core install script
again.

how do i close all open buffers?
